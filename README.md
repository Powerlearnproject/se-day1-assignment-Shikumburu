#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering develops and maintains high quality software systems with the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools. Its importance in the tech industry includes creation of software applications and systems that are used in real life such as in healthcare, communication, businesses, transport, among others. To clearly see this importance, some of the systems and applications software engineering has enabled are like; Facebook, Google, mobile apps such as uber, and even IoT devices.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include;
1 The development of programming languages like Fortran, C, and establishment of software engineering as a discipline came in 1960s, 
2 the begining of structured programming in 1970s,
3 and rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software development life cycle consists of 6 phases namely;
1 Requirements- This phase involves findind and documenting users needs and system or application requirements
2 Design- It involves creating quality designs of software architecture and user interface
3 Implementation- This is where the code is written according to the design specified and software is built
4 Testing- Every software must undergo testing to ensure it meets required functionality and desired quality
5 Deployment- This is where the software is finnaly released or launched for use to customers
6 Manitenance- After the software is released for use, the developer often needs to offer maintenance periodically to ensure its continued use functionality

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology uses a sequential manner of development like it could use the phases in order from requirements to maintenance whereas Agile methodology uses an increment manner, its main aim being flexibility, collaboration, and ability to change. If a project or scenario has strict deadlines waterfall would be more ideal as opposed to agile method. An example of where waterfall method would be more suitable is the aurospace industry, there is always room for little or no error, so the flexibility of these kinds of projects such as sending rockets to space is not high, therefore agile method is not suitable here. Agile method can be more suitable in like web applications since their design and applications are flexible and can change a lot.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software development, quality assurance engineering, and project management are among the roles of software engineering and what software engineering involves as a whole. 
Software Developer roles- A software developer writes codes, builds the software or implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer- A Qulity Assurance Engineer creates test plans, designs, and executes them to ensure high quality software.
Project Manager- A Project Manager plans, develops, implements, and delivers software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide software tools for writing codes, debugging, and testing codes. Examples of them include; Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Intellij IDEA. VCS provide tracking for changes to source codes and coordinates work among teammates. Such sytems are like; Subversion and Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1 Strict deadlines- tight deadlines are a big challenge for software engineers. I would suggest a proper delegation of roles and giving each roles to different experts within the team, If one is very good at project management, then the project development, planning, and delivery should be assigned to them, also software development, quality assurance engineering, system architect, and UI/UX design, should be assigned to the best across the team to allow fast and quality projects and greater collaboration. 
2 Technical Debt- Using suboptimal solutions for projects can accrue technical debt due to increased maintenance costs, and constant future redevelopments. I would suggest including substantially quality applications if the budget is too tight or apply for funding and investment inorder to use the best solutions to prevent future costs accruement. 
3 Changing requirements- If the requirements of a project keeps on shifting or being evolved when the project development is still ongoing, that causes project delays, costs increment, and even the scope keeps on being distorted. I would sugest setting short and long term project scope, budget, and plans for flexible projects and those that are subject to changes and evolvement to curb any shocks or changes faster and give room for ammendments.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1 Unit Testing- This is the testing of modules and individual components of software.
2 Integartion Testing- This tests the software's interaction between different components and subsytems.
3 System Testing- This now tests the software in its entirety.
4 Acceptance Testing- This tests the software against its user and functionality requirements to enure it is meeting user needs.
The importance of these testing in software quality assurance is that they help identify issues and bugs early to fix them early which achieves a high quality software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the way in which one interacts with AI, it is what tells the AI what information is needed and presents it in a way that AI would perform the task. Prompt engineering is important to AI models as it is what gives clear instructions the the models, it improves text queries and instructions to AI instruments.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt; How do I bake a cake?
Clear, specific, concise prompt; How do I bake a vanilla cake for 10 people on an electric oven, what temperature should I use and what ingredients should I have?
The second prompt is more effective as it is clear on the type of cake, the number of people the cake should feed so that the AI would give the appropriate ingredient measurements. It is also specific that the means of baking is an electric oven so that the correct temperature would be prompted, and is concise as it has briefly stated the type of cake, means of baking, number of people it feeds and the ingredients to use. The first prompt is very vague as there are different types of cake and different ingredients are used for the same.
